# splunk_mattermost

This is a Splunk app that will add a custom alert action which will allow you to alert to a Mattermost server

This was based off the work done by Florian Coulmier https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4367/

There version didn't support python3 so it needed updating. I have also added the ability to message different channels. If this is left blank it will use the default channel that was set when the intergration was created.
